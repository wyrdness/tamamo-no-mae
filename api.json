      "full": "Tamamo-no-Mae (玉藻前), meaning \\\"Lady Duckweed\\\" or \\\"Jeweled Maiden,\\\" is one of the most notorious and powerful shapeshifting fox spirits in Japanese folklore. Unlike typical kitsune who might play pranks or form relationships with humans, Tamamo-no-Mae represents a malevolent, ancient evil whose schemes operated on a grand scale. Disguised as a breathtakingly beautiful court lady, she infiltrated the highest levels of Imperial power during the Heian period, nearly assassinating Emperor Toba through a mysterious illness that drained his life force. Her legend intertwines political intrigue, supernatural horror, and themes of deception across multiple Asian cultures."
